Hi sonique fans !!

here comes another visual from CoR...
Spec'n'Hopp is a vis that forms the spectrum data
to eight 3d columns reacting to the music.
The floor of the plugin is well polished so that
the spectrum is reflected by it ;)
In addition to this there are few (or more if
requested, up to 200) little funny hoppers jumping
over the floor of the vis.

search your vis.ini for following lines to change
the setting of the vis:

[CoR's Spec'n'Hopp 1.0]
Enable_3d_Spectrum=1		: 0 = spectrum off
Enable_Grid=1			: 0 = grid off
Hopper_Speed=1.0
Hopper's_Head_Size=10.0
Number_of_Hoppers(max_200)=40	: try 200 with grid off and spectrum off 
Number_of_Stars(max_1000)=1000

thanks "hopp" out to:
	ian, sam for helping me with testing and design !!
	and all who wrote me mails asking for a new plugin
	you guys can't see me sleeping ? ;)

enjoy...........
