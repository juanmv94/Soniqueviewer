Faited 1.01 - Sonique Visualisation Plugin
	Created by mykel

Contact: mykel@earthling.net

Description/Instructions:
	Thought I'd have a play with some pretty coloured dots.  Size,
	position, speed of rotation and speed of colour change all change
	with the music.

	The only config options worth worrying about are

		[faited]
		Seasick=0 or 1
		Blocky=0 or 1

	If seasick is 1, there is a mild wave on the movement.
	Blocky determines how individual points are drawn.  If
	you have blocky=0 I would suggest blur & smoke buy no
	zoom at about 75%.  With blocky=1 (the default) the
	vis FX settings have less (but some) impact.

	Changes should be made in the sonique.ini in your
	windows directory, or, if you've got a more recent
	version, vis.ini in the sonique install directory.

Development:
	Not having Visual C++, nor indeed much in the way of graphics
	tools, this is all done from scratch in Borland C++, which
	probably explains why it is so horribly processor intensive.

Comments, questions, suggestions, abuse all welcome at

.. actually, not so much of the abuse.
